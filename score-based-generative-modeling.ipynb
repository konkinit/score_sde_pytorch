        "### Score and Score-Based Models\n",
        "Given a probablity density function $p(\\mathbf{x})$, we define the *score* as $$\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p(\\mathbf{x}).$$ As you might guess, score-based generative models are trained to estimate $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p(\\mathbf{x})$. Unlike likelihood-based models such as flow models or autoregressive models, score-based models do not have to be normalized and are easier to parameterize. For example, consider a non-normalized statistical model $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{e^{-E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})}}{Z_\\theta}$, where $E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is called the energy function and $Z_\\theta$ is an unknown normalizing constant that makes $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})$ a proper probability density function. The energy function is typically parameterized by a flexible neural network. When training it as a likelihood model, we need to know the normalizing constant $Z_\\theta$ by computing complex high-dimensional integrals, which is typically intractable. In constrast, when computing its score, we obtain $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})$ which does not require computing the normalizing constant $Z_\\theta$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, any neural network that maps an input vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ to an output vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ can be used as a score-based model, as long as the output and input have the same dimensionality. This yields huge flexibility in choosing model architectures.\n",

        "### Perturbing Data with a Diffusion Process\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to generate samples with score-based models, we need to consider a [diffusion process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process) that corrupts data slowly into random noise. Scores will arise when we reverse this diffusion process for sample generation. You will see this later in the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "A diffusion process is a [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process#:~:text=A%20stochastic%20or%20random%20process%20can%20be%20defined%20as%20a,an%20element%20in%20the%20set.) similar to [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion). Their paths are like the trajectory of a particle submerged in a flowing fluid, which moves randomly due to unpredictable collisions with other particles. Let $\\{\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\}_{t=0}^T$ be a diffusion process, indexed by the continuous time variable $t\\in [0,T]$. A diffusion process is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE), in the following form\n",

You can understand an SDE as a stochastic generalization to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Particles moving according to an SDE not only follows the deterministic drift $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, but are also affected by the random noise coming from $g(t) d\\mathbf{w}$. From now on, we use $p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ to denote the distribution of $\\mathbf{x}(t)$. \n",
        "\n",
        "For score-based generative modeling, we will choose a diffusion process such that $\\mathbf{x}(0) \\sim p_0$, and $\\mathbf{x}(T) \\sim p_T$. Here $p_0$ is the data distribution where we have a dataset of i.i.d. samples, and $p_T$ is the prior distribution that has a tractable form and easy to sample from. The noise perturbation by the diffusion process is large enough to ensure $p_T$ does not depend on $p_0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reversing the Diffusion Process Yields Score-Based Generative Models\n",
        "By starting from a sample from the prior distribution $p_T$ and reversing the diffusion process, we will be able to obtain a sample from the data distribution $p_0$. Crucially, the reverse process is a diffusion process running backwards in time. It is given by the following reverse-time SDE\n",

We can train a time-dependent score-based model $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ to approximate $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$, using the following weighted sum of [denoising score matching](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/Publications/smdae_techreport.pdf) objectives.\n",

For a time step $t$, the corresponding Gaussian random feature is defined as \n",

        "Aside from generic numerical SDE solvers, we can leverage special properties of our reverse-time SDE for better solutions. Since we have an estimate of the score of $p_t(\\mathbf{x}(t))$ via the score-based model, i.e., $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}(t)} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x}(t))$, we can leverage score-based MCMC approaches, such as Langevin MCMC, to correct the solution obtained by numerical SDE solvers.\n",

When $N\\to\\infty$ and $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the final value $\\mathbf{x}_{N+1}$ becomes a sample from $p(\\mathbf{x})$ under some regularity conditions. Therefore, given $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$, we can get an approximate sample from $p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ by running several steps of Langevin MCMC, replacing $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ with $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in the iteration rule.\n",

Next, we apply several steps of Langevin MCMC to refine $\\mathbf{x}_t$, such that $\\mathbf{x}_t$ becomes a more accurate sample from $p_{t-\\Delta t}(\\mathbf{x})$. This is the \"corrector\" step as the MCMC helps reduce the error of the numerical SDE solver. "
