# Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations

Forked from [yang-song/score_sde_pytorch](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch), this repo applies 
Score-Based Generative Modeling on Retinal OCT images.

## Get started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/konkinit/score_sde_pytorch.git
```

2. Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_local]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

3. Load a pretrained checkpoint
```bash
bash get_checkpoint.sh -i 1JInV8bPGy18QiIzZcS1iECGHCuXL6_Nz -p ./exp/ve/cifar10_ncsnpp_continuous/checkpoint.pth
```

## Dataset

The datset used for experiment is Fashion-MNIST, a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training \
set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with \
a label from 10 classes.

## Results

### Score-based model training
