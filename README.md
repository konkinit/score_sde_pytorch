# Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations

Forked from [yang-song/score_sde_pytorch](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch), this repo applies 
Score-Based Generative Modeling on Retinal OCT images.

## Get started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/konkinit/score_sde_pytorch.git
```

2. Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_local]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

## Dataset

The datset used for experiment is Fashion-MNIST, a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training \
set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with \
a label from 10 classes.

## Experminets & Results

We have chosen the forward SDE to be $ d \mathbf{x} = \sigma^t d\mathbf{w}, \quad t\in[0,1] $. Formulated as this \
it is a Varaince Exploding SDE. After training the score-based generative model, the reverse-time SDE can be \
approximated by $ d \mathbf{x} = -\sigma^{2t} s_{\theta} (\mathbf{x}, t) dt + \sigma^t d \bar{\mathbf{w}} $.

### Score-based model training

The trained model is a time-dependent score-based model built upon `U-Net` architecture.
